abstract: Current climate warming, the increased ocean pollution, the acidification of the oceans, and the manifold forms of habitat destruction endanger modern marine ecosystems. To understand the extent, causes and consequences of the ongoing global change, quantitative data about the change through time must be compiled. Furthermore, methods to identify and monitor the impact of climate change and anthropogenic stress on an ecosystem through time together with indicators of the ecological condition of the environment are vitally needed.
