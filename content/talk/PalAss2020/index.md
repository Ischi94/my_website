abstract: Biodiversity dynamics are shaped by a complex interplay between current conditions and historic legacy. While a simple relationship is often used to link evolution with temperature, short-term climate change likely interacts with previous temperature trends when influencing the pace of origination. Such palaeoclimate interactions have been demonstrated for extinction risk, but the effect on evolutionary dynamics is untested. Here we show that origination probability in marine fossil groups is largely affected by palaeoclimate interactions. Short-term cooling adding to a long-term cooling trend increases the origination probability by 23.7%. This large effect is consistent through time and all studied groups. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity is controlled by a complex array of ecological and evolutionary factors, with mutual interactions. The mechanisms of the detected effect might be manifold but are likely connected to eustatic sea level drop caused by cumulative global cooling. Accounting for complex interactions using a dynamic modelling approach improves existing models and enables a better mechanistic discernment of processes that control biodiversity.
