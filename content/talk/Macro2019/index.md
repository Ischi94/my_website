abstract: Several researchers have attempted to subdivide the Phanerozoic record of reefs into
  discrete units. Modern analytical tools now enable an advanced categorization of Phanerozoic
  reefs and facilitate determination of underlying causes of large-scale reef evolution. The aim
  of this study is to subdivide the evolutionary history of reefs into discrete units to quantify
  evolutionary and ecologic change at the ecosystem level
